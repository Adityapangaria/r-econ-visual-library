# R Econ Visual Library

This repository contains graphs created in R to explore impact evaluation data sets and display results. The Library plots and codes can be viewed [here](https://worldbank.github.io/r-econ-visual-library/). The folders in the repository contain the `.Rmd` files that can be used to replicate the images in the Library.
